CLKC-40#1 Advisory
Substitute PLLE4 for MMCME4 check  
The MMCME4 cell design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst has a single input clock whose source driver, UNKNOWN, is not optimally located and the MMCM has a configuration which could be accommodated by a PLL.  Consider changing the MMCM to a PLL which could align better with the input clock driver.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) design_1_i/zynq_ultra_ps_e_0/inst/buffer_pl_clk_0.PL_CLK_0_BUFG and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
